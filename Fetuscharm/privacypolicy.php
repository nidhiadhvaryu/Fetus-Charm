Policy, you consent to the collection and use of the information you disclose on the Platform in
accordance with this Policy, including but not limited to your consent for sharing your
information as per this Policy. We encourage you to read this Policy regarding the collection,
use, and disclosure of your information. If you are not comfortable with any of the terms or
policies described in this Policy, you may choose to discontinue usage of the Platform.</p></li>
     <li><p class="mb-6" style="text-align:justify;">Further, you agree and consent to receive all communications related to our services on the
mobile number provided by you to the Company, even if such mobile number is registered under
DND/NCPR list under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference
Regulations, 2018 (“<b>TRAI Regulations</b>”). Notwithstanding your registration with the National
Do Not Call Registry (In Fully or Partly blocked category under National Customer Preference
Register set up under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), you hereby express your
interest and accord informed consent to receive communications (including commercial
communications) in relation to the Company’s services. You further confirm that no
communication to you from the Company or on behalf of the Company shall be construed as
Unsolicited Commercial Communication under Regulation 2(bw) of the TRAI Regulations and
you have specifically opted to receive communications in this regard on the mobile number
provided by you.
</p></li>
     <li><p class="mb-6" style="text-align:justify;">For the purpose of this Policy, the term “<b>Personal Information</b>” shall mean any information
that relates to you, which, either directly or indirectly, in combination with other information
available or likely to be available with the Company, is capable of identifying you, which is
submitted to and/or collected over the Platform and maintained by the Company in an accessible
form, provided that, any information that is freely available or accessible in public domain or
furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005 or any other law for the time being in force
shall not be regarded as Personal Information for the purposes of this Policy.</p></li>
</ul>
     <b><p class="mb-6" style="text-align:justify;">HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p></b>
    <p class="mb-6" style="text-align:justify;"> We communicate with you through a variety of means and channels, including our Platform,
email, phone or text messaging on your mobile phone, although we do generally note that our
preferred means of communication is email which has the least impact on the environment. Such
communications may involve giving to you, as well as receiving information from you. We
collect and receive the Personal Information in the following ways:</p>

     <ul>
     <li><p class="mb-6" style="text-align:justify;"><b>When you submit your Personal Information on our Platform:</b> The Company collects and

and the browser version your computer is operating. Passive information collection technologies
can make your use of the Platform easier by allowing the Company to provide better service,
customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyze trends, and otherwise
administer and improve the Platform. Certain features of the Platform may not work without use
of passive information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies
cannot be used to identify you without additional identifiable information. We may also

deliver your next purchase more easily. Further, we may receive information about you from
third parties that feature our Products or promotional offers if you opt-in to receive information
from us. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or social media sites
through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) Personal Information about
